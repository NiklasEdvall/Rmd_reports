The variable of this subject happened to be `r as.character(vars[i])`

## Figure 1

With some explanatory text here.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste("figures/", subs[i], "-", fig1, sep=""))
```

## Figure 2

Here is also text, slighty longer.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste("figures/", subs[i], "-", fig2, sep=""))
```

## Figure 3

No text for figure three. No wait, this is text.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste("figures/", subs[i], "-", fig3, sep=""))
```
